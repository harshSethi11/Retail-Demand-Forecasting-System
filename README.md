# Retail-Demand-Forecasting-System

This project builds a complete production-ready forecasting pipeline using:
1) Kaggle Favorita dataset (Walmart-scale retail dataset)
2)Polars for fast feature engineering (Spark alternative)
3)LightGBM for sales forecasting

Problem StatementRetail companies need to predict next-day item sales for thousands of store–item combinations.This helps:
1)optimize inventory
2)reduce stockouts
3)plan pricing
4)manage promotions

I built a time-series forecasting model that uses recent sales history, promotions and rolling statistics to predict the next day’s demand.
