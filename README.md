# Retail-Demand-Forecasting-System

This project builds a complete production-ready forecasting pipeline using:
1) Kaggle Favorita dataset (Walmart-scale retail dataset)
2) Polars for fast feature engineering 
3) LightGBM for sales forecasting


Problem Statement: Retail companies need to predict next-day item sales for thousands of store–item combinations.
This helps:
1) optimize inventory
2) reduce stockouts
3) plan pricing
4) manage promotions

I build a time-series forecasting model that uses recent sales history, promotions and rolling statistics to predict the next day’s demand.
