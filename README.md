# Retail-Demand-Forecasting-System

This project builds a complete production-ready forecasting pipeline using:
1) Kaggle Favorita dataset (Walmart-scale retail dataset)

Polars for fast feature engineering (Spark alternative)

LightGBM for sales forecasting

Prediction API (FastAPI) + CLI tool

Modular, industry-grade ML code

This project demonstrates real-world ML skills:
data cleaning → feature engineering → model training → evaluation → deployment → inference.

🧠 Problem Statement

Retail companies need to predict next-day item sales for thousands of store–item combinations.

This helps:

optimize inventory

reduce stockouts

plan pricing

manage promotions

We build a time-series forecasting model that uses recent sales history, promotions, and rolling statistics to predict the next day’s demand.
